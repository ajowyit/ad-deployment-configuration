<p>
 - This hshould open up the Active Directory Domain Services Configuration Wizard in a popup window. In "Deployment Configuration", under "Select the deployment operation", select "Add a new forest". Name it "mydomain.com" and then click on "Next >".
<p> 
 - In "Domain Controller Options", for the DSRM password, just use Password1. We won't be using this at all so it is unimportant. Click on "Next >" until you get to Prerequisites Check. In "DNS Options" if "Specify DNS delecgation options" is checked, uncheck it.</p>
<br />

<p>
 <img width="763" alt="Screenshot 2025-06-05 at 4 42 32‚ÄØPM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ef98658f-cf0d-4cd8-96c3-7812a0aaca86" />
</p>

<p>
 - After clicking "Next >" until all options have been configured, click "Install" to start the installation.
</p>
<p>
 - Once the install is finished, DC-1 will reboot. Then Remote Desktop back into DC-1 as a domain user
</p>
<br />

<p>
<img width="1013" alt="Screenshot 2025-06-05 at 5 26 27‚ÄØPM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6e9d5081-e79f-4d9a-9b75-e9005a3cd94e" />
</p>
<p>
 - Remote Desktop back into DC-1. Since DC-1 is now a domain controller and on the domain, you have to specify which domain, and that you want to log on as a domain user.</p>  
<p>- When logging into DC-1 as a domain user, enter "mydomain.com\ajowyit" (mydomain.com\username) and your password</p>
<p>- This will log us in as a specific user within the domain.</p>
<br />

<h3>Step 2: Create a Domain Admin User within the Domain</h3>

<p>
 <img width="836" alt="Screenshot 2025-06-06 at 6 40 23‚ÄØPM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ab307b12-26f0-4391-b01e-e2b395bb7543" />
</p>

<p>
 - Once logged back into the DC-1 virtual machine, open up Windows Administrative Tools.
</p>

<p>
 <img width="1125" alt="Screenshot 2025-06-06 at 6 41 39‚ÄØPM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3b683213-4e74-4615-bbe9-2c6f643c34a3" />

 <img width="1399" alt="Screenshot 2025-06-06 at 6 42 39‚ÄØPM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/51b476b8-3064-47d3-9a4e-ba1a028336f3" />
</p>

<p>
 - Once the Administrative Tools window is open, click on "Active Directory Users and Computers". This will open the "Active Directory Users and Computers" window. 
</p>


<p>
 <img width="754" alt="Screenshot 2025-06-06 at 6 42 50‚ÄØPM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9d165767-f5aa-4459-8797-9cde490d938d" />

 <img width="438" alt="Screenshot 2025-06-06 at 6 43 03‚ÄØPM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/385f3900-27f1-4ffc-ae10-e49ebee5a1bd" />
</p>

<p> 
 - Now we will create a new Organizational Unit (OU). 
</p>
<p>
 - Right-click mydomain.com -> New -> Organizational Unit. This will open a window to create a new Organizational Unit.
</p>
<p>
 - Name the new Organizational Unit "_EMPLOYEES". Make sure there is an underscore in the beginning. Finish by clicking "OK". 
</p>

<br />

<p>
 <img width="438" alt="Screenshot 2025-06-06 at 6 44 31‚ÄØPM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/728e9299-0981-4ca4-a2db-29663b224530" />
</p>

<p>
 - Next we will create another new Organizational Unit for admins called _ADMINS.
</p>
<p>
 - Right-click mydomain.com -> New -> Organizational Unit to create the new one. Name this OU as _ADMINS (don't forget the underscore). Click OK.
</p>

<br />

<p>
<img width="755" alt="Screenshot 2025-06-06 at 6 45 00‚ÄØPM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/536766f9-41a5-4ee9-bf89-1b7b117bf4a8" />

</p>
<p>
 - Now, make sure mydomain.com is selected and select the Refresh icon at the top. This will move our new OUs to the top of the list for easier location and access.</p>  
<br />

<p>
<img width="752" alt="Screenshot 2025-06-06 at 6 47 25‚ÄØPM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/439df63f-4d73-498a-be6a-ec45e5e31c32" />

</p>
<p>
 - Next, we will create a new user.
</p> 
<p>
 - Right-click _ADMINS -> go to "New" -> click "User".
</p>
<p>
 - Name the new user as Jane Doe, with the first name "Jane" and the last name "Doe". Click "Next >".
</p>
<p>
 - Use the same password as you did for DC-1 to make it easy to remember. Select "Password never expires". In the real world we shouldn't do this for security purposes but for the sake of this project it is okay. Click "Next >".
</p>
<p>
 - Finally, click "Finish" to create the new user. 
</p>
<br />


<p>
<img width="754" alt="Screenshot 2025-06-06 at 7 04 07‚ÄØPM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4bfb24c0-e474-48c9-a5b1-76e3edbc7bb5" />

</p>
<p>
 - Now, we will make "Jane Doe" account we just created a Domain Admin by adding it to the built-in "Domain Admins" Security Group. 
</p> 
<p>
 - Open the _ADMINS folder by clicking on it -> right-click Jane Doe -> click "Properties". This will open the Jane Doe Properties window.
</p>
<p>
 - Click on "Member Of" at the top. Then click "Add...", the Select Groups window should pop up. Under "Enter the object names to select (examples):" type in "domain admins". Click "Check Names". 
</p>
<p>
 - Domain names should now be capitalized and underlined. Click "OK"
</p>
<br />

<p>

</p>

<p>
 - Jane Doe is now a Domain Admin. Click "OK".
</p>
<p>
 - Next, log out and close the DC-1 connection. Log back into DC-1 with Jane Doe's Admin login. We will use this account from now on. Make sure you take a note of Jane Doe's login info for later use.
</p>
<br />

<h3>Step 3: Join Client-1 to the Domain</h3>
